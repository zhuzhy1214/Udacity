# Udacity

Stackoverflow has this great survey. <br>
As a developer, I have questions about my career as well as my children. <br>
These problems are general enough that I would expect other developers like me might be interested in as well. <br>
Therefore, I did some statistical data exploration and find some quite interesting insights.<br>


A companion Medium post with summerized findings is available at: <br>
